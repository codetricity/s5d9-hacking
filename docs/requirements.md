# Hacking requirements

## OS 
As of 7/29/2017, the board cannot mount on a Mac.  You need Windows 7 or 10
to really use the board and tools. You can mount the board on Linux, but you
will not be able to use Synergy. 

## Data Monitoring and Data Intelligence

- Ethernet with Internet access
- USB cable to power the board (you can power it from your laptop)
- web browser to display dashboard

The unit below came with the S3A7 IoT Fast Prototyping Kit. I heard that it normally 
costs $30 separately. The unit below works.

I went online and saw similar units on sale on eBay for $11 to $17. I do not know if 
any of the units on eBay work. If you have a unit that works, please post information.
