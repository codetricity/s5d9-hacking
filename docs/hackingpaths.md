With so many options, getting started hacking the board can be bewildering. I recommend
you follow the sequence below in the order presented. Go to the free site
[IoTcommunity.io](http://learn.iotcommunity.io/) for tutorials that will get you started.

1. [Data Monitoring](monitoring/starting.md) (Bug Labs default system image)
2. [Data Intelligence](intelligence/overview.md) (Medium One binaries and cloud-based workflows)
3. Build your custom image (Professional C/C++ development system)
    * Custom image that uses bootloader (`Put binary here` folder)
    * [Custom image that replaces bootloader](synergy/custom.md)
4. [Designing your own board](design/files.md)
