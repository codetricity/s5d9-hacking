## Hacking Paths

With so many options, getting started hacking the board can be bewildering. I recommend
you follow the sequence below in the order presented. Go to the free site
[IoTcommunity.io](http://learn.iotcommunity.io/) for tutorials that will get you started.

1. Data Monitoring (Bug Labs default system image)
2. Data Intelligence (Medium One binaries and cloud-based workflows)
3. [Build your custom image](synergy/custom.md) (Professional C/C++ development system)
    * Use factory default bootloader (`Put binary here` folder)
    * Replacing factory image with your custom image
4. [Designing your own board](design/files.md)
