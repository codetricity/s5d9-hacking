It costs $35 and Renesas is currently\noffering a \n$20 coupon\n, \nwhich reduces the cost to $15 plus shipping (from the factory in China). In addition to the\nRenesas S5D9 MCU, you get a lot of onboard sensors:\n\n\n\n\nBosch BMC 150 6-Axis sensor\n\n\nAMS ENS210 environmental sensor\n\n\nTE Connectivity MS5637-02BA03 barometric pressure sensor\n\n\nKnowles SPU0414HR5H-SB amplified SiSonic microphone\n\n\n\n\nThe board also has 3 colored LEDs on the board plus Ethernet, USB, PMOD 2 Grove connectors and\na JTAG connector. \n\n\nPrevious kits with this level of peripherals would have cost $150 6 months ago $500 a few\nyears ago. Including sensors on the board, eliminated the costs of many external \nperipherals. To make the board price even more attractive, Renesas made\n several trade-offs. These decisions made the board even more attractive\n to hackers. At the current price of $15 (after discount, but without\nshipping), it's an astounding price drop and a compelling value.\n\n\nThe S5D9 kit does not come with these components:\n\n\n\n\nno LCD touchscreen (which is fine for most projects and you can add it's possible to hack one on later). The previous S3A7 kit\ncame with a New Haven 2.4\" LCD. It made the board bigger and more expensive.\n\n\nno Segger debugger. The S3A7 kit came with a J-Link Lite Cortex-M 9-Pin debugger. The board comes with a bootloader. You can use a normal USB cable to load binaries on the board. \n\n\nno USB or Ethernet cables. This is no problem as the cables are standard and cheap.\n\n\n\n\nThe board can be used to learn Synergy, which is an amazing embedded development environment\nfor professionals. It's also a\ngreat way to learn about cloud-based IoT systems like Renesas Data Monitoring (Bug Labs) and\nRenesas Data Intelligence (Medium One).\n\n\nIn addition to all the free access to software and tools, the design files for the board are \nopen sourced. You can use the board files to develop your own IoT device. \n\n\nHacking Paths\n\n\nWith so many options, getting started hacking the board can be bewildering. I recommend\nyou follow the sequence below in the order presented. Go to the free site\n\nIoTcommunity.io\n for tutorials that will get you started.\n\n\n\n\nData Monitoring (Bug Labs default system image)\n\n\nData Intelligence (Medium One binaries and cloud-based workflows)\n\n\nRenesas Synergy (Professional C/C++ development system)\n\n\nUse factory default bootloader (\nPut binary here\n folder)\n\n\nReplacing factory image with your custom image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning your own board\n\n\n\n\nBefore You Hack\n\n\n\n\ntechnical requirements",
